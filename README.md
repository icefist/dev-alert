# dev-alert
Have you had the prod and dev version of the same page open next to each other? Have you (almost?) made an oopsie on prod, because you thought it's dev?
If so, here's a solution for you! 

A Chrome extension that adds a banner on the top for .local and .test domains and puts [DEV] prefix in the title

How to install:
- Clone this repository `git clone github.com/icefist/dev-alert`
- Open `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome
- Click to enable `Developer mode` on the top _right_ corner of the page
- Click on `Load unpacked` on the top _left_ corner (just under the logo)
- Select the folder where you cloned the repo
- Refresh any related page
